# Advent of Code 2020

I think Advent of Code is a great way to learn a new language and brush up on algorithms.
TI plan to re-learn C++ and this repo is a placeholder for all my solutions.

The idea is to attempt to solve each day's problem, first by myself, with no bar on code quality and algorithmic complexity. Just to learn the language and to hack a working solution using what ever I can.
Then, improve the algorithmic complexity. I'll probably be taking help & confirming my thought process from others and online forums (annotating the fact whenever I do that).
And finally, work on using modern language features to improve the code itself.
