# Advent of Code

I think Advent of Code is a great way to learn a new language and brush up on algorithms.

With Advent of Code 2020, I tried to learn C++. Unfortunately, I didn't keep up with all the problems and stopped quite early. Same goes for 2021, I simply didn't have time to participate in 2021. However, I'll try to bring it in this time around in 2022, and I'm going to be trying C++ again.

# Outlook

1. Solve each day's problem, first by myself, with no bar on code quality and algorithmic complexity. Just to learn the language and to hack a working solution.
2. Then, improve the algorithmic complexity. I'll probably be taking help & confirming my thought process from others and online forums (annotating the fact whenever I do that).
3. And finally, work on using modern language features to improve the code itself. This may or may not retroactively reflect on older code.
