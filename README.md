# Advent of Code 2020

<p>I think Advent of Code is a great way to learn a new language and brush up on algorithms.</p>
<p>I plan to re-learn C++ and this repo is a placeholder for all my solutions.</p>

The idea is to attempt to:

1. Solve each day's problem, first by myself, with no bar on code quality and algorithmic complexity. Just to learn the language and to hack a working solution.
2. Then, improve the algorithmic complexity. I'll probably be taking help & confirming my thought process from others and online forums (annotating the fact whenever I do that).
3. And finally, work on using modern language features to improve the code itself. This may or may not retroactively reflect on older code.

## Updates

- day2 - Start using testcases.
- day4 - Testcases save the day.
